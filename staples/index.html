      <h2>feature crop</h2>
      The FeatureCrop transformation tries to determine the most important features of the input image and performs a crop around as many of these features as possible.<br>
      FeatureCrop works very similarly to RegionOfInterestCrop except for the region of interest is specified automatically by the found features instead of manually.
      <p>
          Feature crop (300x300): IMQuery FeatureCrop,width=300,height=300<br>
        <img src="/staples/image2.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,width=300,height=300"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Feature crop (300x300) and resize (100) IMQuery im=FeatureCrop,width=300,height=300;Resize=100"<br>
     <img src="/staples/image2.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,width=300,height=300;Resize=100"/>
